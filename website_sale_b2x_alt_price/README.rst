This module takes into account if your eCommerce is in B2B or B2C mode, and
displays the alternative pricing next to the main one.

For example, if your website is B2B (main price is without taxes), you would
see it similar to this:

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/e-commerce/12.0/website_sale_b2x_alt_price/static/description/b2b-features.png
   :alt: B2B features showcase

If your website is B2C (main price is with taxes), then it looks like this:

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/e-commerce/12.0/website_sale_b2x_alt_price/static/description/b2c-features.png
   :alt: B2C features showcase

It also displays the alternative price, including discounts, updated
automatically when the user is choosing alternatives in the product detail
page:

Configuration
=============

To choose if you want to display or not the alternative price in the website
products list, just enable or disable the feature from the "Customize" menu.
This can be done independently per website:

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/e-commerce/12.0/website_sale_b2x_alt_price/static/description/toggle-list.gif
   :alt: How to disable and enable the feature in products list

You can also toggle the behavior similarly in the product details page.

#. Create a product.
#. Set some customer taxes on it.
#. Publish it.
#. Go see it on your website. It will display the alternative price.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Computing this requires 1 or 2 extra calls to ``taxes.compute_all()`` per
  product. This could be expensive in terms of performance, but the truth is
  that it is also not very optimized upstream in Odoo. Maybe optimize this part
  in Odoo and in this module? Or maybe apply some hack to avoid recomputing
  this? Maybe cache calls to that method? Is it really a problem in the
  Real WorldÂ®?
