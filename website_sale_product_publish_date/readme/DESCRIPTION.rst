This module adds expected publish/unpublish date fields to the product.
Products will not be displayed on the shop page of the website if there are values
for these fields and the current date is not within the range of the publish and unpublish dates.

This function can be useful if you run an eCommerce platform where a set of products need to be sold for a scheduled timeframe.
