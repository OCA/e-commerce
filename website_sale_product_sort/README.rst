This module allows to set a default sorting criteria for the e-commerce product
list.

It provides the standard criterias, but allows to extend the options via third
modules.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Website > Configuration > Settings*
#. Select the website you want to configure.
#. In the *Product* section there's a *Sort Criteria* option that you
   can set as the default one for the website selected.

To extend the module you can override the method providing sorting options like
this:

  .. code-block:: python

    @api.model
    def _get_product_sort_criterias(self):
      res = super()._get_product_sort_criterias()
      return res.append(("default_code asc", _("Reference - A to Z")))

Usage
=====

After you've configured the default website settings:

#. Go to the configured website shop url.
#. The products will be sorted by default by the chosen option.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Could be nice to have a related model to configure the sorting options without
  the need of third modules.
