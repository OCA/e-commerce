This module was written to extend the functionality of product filtering on website.
It will allow you to filter product based on its brand.

While shopping online, we have seen various eShops having a feature to shop by brands
which ODOO does not yet provide officially. Website Sale Product Brand fills the gap
at certain extent and by providing basic search by brands, thus reducing end-user’s
efforts in searching the products he/she wants to purchase.
