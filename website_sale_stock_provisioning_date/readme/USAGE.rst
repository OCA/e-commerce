To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Products > Products*, create a new product or edit an
   existing one.
#. Check 'Show Next Provisioning Date' field under eCommerce tab.
#. Go to Website Shop.
#. Click on a product that have 'Show Next Provisioning Date' checked.
#. If it is true for that product that
   `'quantity on hand' - 'outgoing quantity' <= 0`,
   then you will see the future provisioning date closest to
   the current date for this product under the 'Add to Cart' button
   (If there is such a date).

Note: The closest future provisioning date is the date of the future
stock movement and the closest to the current date. This can be
generated after confirming a purchase order to receive the product on
a date after the current date.
