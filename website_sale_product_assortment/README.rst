Configuration
=============

To see this module working, you have to define a product assortment and select
an option on the website availability field.

#. **Don't apply restriction**: This option will not set any kind of restriction on
product items.
#. **Avoid to show non available products**: This option will hide on the e-commerce, the
products that are not added to the products domain. If a product template has at least
one allowed variant to show, the product will appear on the product items view but only
that variants will be able to be bought.
#. **Avoid selling not available products**: This option will restrict to buy the
products that are added to the assortment on the e-commerce. To inform the clients,
two more fields were added: "Message when unavailable" and "Assortment information".
The first one will add a short description to the product item and the other one will set a
detailed description on the product sheet. This second one is editable from the website editor.
