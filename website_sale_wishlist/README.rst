Ecommerce Wishlist
========================

This module extends the functionality of the ecommerce module and introduces a wishlist feature.
The users are able to save the products they are interested in in a wishlist so that they can
confirm the purchase later on.

Usage
=====

Open some products pages on the e-commerce, then hover or click on
'Recent Products' in the top menu. You should see a page or a popover (click
vs hover) with your last viewed products.
