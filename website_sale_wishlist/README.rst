Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Top *Shop* menu is highlighted also when *My Wishlist* is highlighted. You
  are in both, after all.
* If you buy a product, it does not get removed from your wishlist. This is on
  purpose, to let users use their wishlists as some kind of *bookmarks* if they
  want. After all, removing a product is just one click away.
