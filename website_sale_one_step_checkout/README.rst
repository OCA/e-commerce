It also keeps your customer on the checkout page while adding or editing an address:

One Step Checkout combines all Odoo checkout steps into one and removes all unnecessary fields and
questions. Never before has check-out been easier and faster!

Improving the checkout process results in more customers completing their sales, and this has an immediate impact on your bottom line.
It is the single most effective technical change you can make to reduce shopping cart abandonment.
