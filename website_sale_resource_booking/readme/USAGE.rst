To use this module, you need to know how to use ``sale_resource_booking`` and
``resource_booking``. This document doesn't explain the details for those
related modules.

All products that you link to a resource booking type will allow pre-bookings
if sold from your eCommerce. To configure those pre-bookings timeout:

#. Go to the product form in the backend.
#. Use the *Resource booking timeout* field, in the *Sales* tab.

When you go to that product's eCommerce page, you'll see a little message above
the *Add to cart* button, telling the user that they will be able to pre-book it
before buying.

When you add to your cart one (or more) bookable products, you will see in the
eCommerce checkout wizard a new step that you will have to follow to be able to
buy. This step will display a calendar with bookable slots for you to choose.

When you are redirected to payment, make sure to pay before your pre-bookings
expire!
