==========================================
Suggest to create user account when buying
==========================================

This module extends the functionality of e-Commerce to suggest
the buyer to log in or create an account, but without forcing him to do it.

This way you can avoid duplication of partners in your database and offer your
users a better experience without blocking 1-time buyers.

However, the *Checkout without sign in* button is not highlighted, to
implicitly encourage users to create the account.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* *Settings > Configuration > General Settings* and enable *Allow external
  users to sign up*.

Otherwise you will notice no change after installing this module.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Log out.
* Buy something from your website.
* Go to your cart.

There you will see the new options.
