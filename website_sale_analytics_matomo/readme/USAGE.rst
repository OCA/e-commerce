Go to the `Dashboard` of Matomo and open the `Ecommerce` section on the left-side menu.

In the `Ecommerce - Overview`, under `Evolution over the period`
you can see an overview of the conversions rates for orders.
Under `Conversions Overview` you have a recap of total Revenue, Subtotal, Tax, etc...

In the `Ecommerce - Ecommerce Log`, you can find the visits log segmented by Goal.

In the `Ecommerce - Products`, you can find the conversion rated grouped by product names,
product SKU and product category.
Notice that by default the `Product SKU` tracked in Matomo corresponds to the Product's `Barcode`
field of Odoo, that represents the "International Article Number used for product identification".
In case `Barcode` is empty, Matomo tracks the standard Odoo `Product ID`.
