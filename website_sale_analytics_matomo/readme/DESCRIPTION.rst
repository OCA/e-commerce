If your website is a webshop, that can be integrated with Matomo Analytics.
With this module you can track the entire sale workflow in Matomo, from adding a product to the
shopping cart to the checkout process.

The following categories of Ecommerce actions are tracked within Matomo:

- Product Views – This enables per-product conversion rates.
- Cart Updates – This enables tracking abandoned cart statistics.
- Order Paid – This is a required component of Ecommerce tracking.

Technically this module extends the websiteSaleTracking feature already present in
standard Odoo module website_sale. The standard feature only works with Google Analytics.
This module makes it working with Matomo as well.
