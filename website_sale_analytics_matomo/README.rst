If your website is a webshop, that can be integrated with Matomo Analytics.
With this module you can track the entire sale workflow in Matomo, from adding a product to the
shopping cart to the checkout process.

The following categories of Ecommerce actions are tracked within Matomo:

- Product Views – This enables per-product conversion rates.
- Cart Updates – This enables tracking abandoned cart statistics.
- Order Updates – This is a required component of Ecommerce tracking.

Configuration
=============

Just follow the configuration steps of website_analytics_matomo and
make sure that it's working properly.

Usage
=====

Go to the `Dashboard` of Matomo and open the `Ecommerce` section on the left-side menu.

In the `Ecommerce - Overview`, under `Evolution over the period`
you can see an overview of the conversions rates for orders.
Under `Conversions Overview` you have a recap of total Revenue, Subtotal, Tax, etc...

In the `Ecommerce - Ecommerce Log`, you can find the visits log segmented by Goal.

In the `Ecommerce - Products`, you can find the conversion rated grouped by product names,
product SKU and product category.
Notice that by default the `Product SKU` tracked in Matomo corresponds to the Product's `Barcode`
field of Odoo, that represents the "International Article Number used for product identification".
In case `Barcode` is empty, Matomo tracks the standard Odoo `Product ID`.
