Website Sale Hide Price
=======================

This module allows to have hidden product prices on the website store.

Configuration
=============

#. Go to *Customers* and choose one.
#. Go to *Sales and Purchases* tab.
#. In *Sales* group set *Show prices on website* on or off so this customer can
   see them or not. The default value is `True`, so every partner website user
   can see the prices.
#. If you wanted to have the prices hidden by default when no user is logged
   in you should go to Public User's partner and set *Show prices on website*
   off.
