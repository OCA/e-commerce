This module allows to have hidden product prices on the website store.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

If you want to hide prices at customer level:

#. Go to *Customers* and choose one.
#. Go to *Sales and Purchases* tab.
#. In *Sales* group set *Show prices on website* on or off so this customer can
   see them or not. The default value is `True`, so every partner website user
   can see the prices.

For not logged in customers:

#. If you want to have the prices hidden by default when no user is logged
   in you should go to Public User's partner and set *Show prices on website*
   off. (Remember that the Public User's user and partner use to be archived).

Hide prices at product level:

#. Go to *Website > Catalog > Products* and choose one.
#. Go to *eCommerce* tab.
#. In the *Shop* section you have the option *Hide prices on website*.
#. You can optionally set a message that will be displayed when the prices are
   hidden.

Usage
=====

After configuring the module go to the website store and check your expected results:

#. On the search box writing the name of a product.
#. On the product list (/shop).
#. On the product page.
#. On the recently viewed products.

You shouldn't be able to either see the prices or buy any of the forbidden items if any.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- This feature doesn't support multi website. The default behavior is to hide the prices
  along every website. It could be modified the boolean field on the partner to a many2many
  relation between res_partner and website_website, so that this price-hiding feature might
  be made website-dependant.
