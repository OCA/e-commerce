If you want to hide prices at customer level:

#. Go to *Customers* and choose one.
#. Go to *Sales and Purchases* tab.
#. In *Sales* group set *Show prices on website* on or off so this customer can
   see them or not. The default value is `True`, so every partner website user
   can see the prices.

For not logged in customers:

#. If you want to have the prices hidden by default when no user is logged
   in you should go to Public User's partner and set *Show prices on website*
   off. (Remember that the Public User's user and partner use to be archived).

Hide prices at product level:

#. Go to *Website > Catalog > Products* and choose one.
#. Go to *eCommerce* tab.
#. In the *Shop* section you have the option *Hide prices on website*.
#. You can optionally set a message that will be displayed when the prices are
   hidden.
