This module lets you publish downloadable attachments in a product page.

This is useful if you want to publish firmwares, manuals, specs,
warranties, or whatever document related to the product.

2. Go to *Settings > Dashboard > Activate the developer mode*.
3. Go to *Settings > Technical > Database Structure > Attachments*.
4. Pick or create one.
5. Enable *Attached To > Is public document*.
6. Use the field *Attached in products* to choose the products.

3. Go to *Settings > Technical > Database Structure > Attachments*
4. Pick or create one.

Usage
=====

To add publicly downloadable attachments to a product template:

1. Go to a *Website > Products > Products* in backend.
2. Pick or create one.
3. Go to the *eCommerce* tab > *Website Attachments*.
4. Add any downloadable attachments you want there. They can exist
   before or be new. They must be public.
5. Save.

Once you set up the product attachments, public users will be able to
download them:

1. Go to the product eCommerce page.
2. Below the product price and description, you will find a dropdown
   labeled as *Product downloads*. Click it.
3. Users will download those attachments from there.
4. Attachments will appear in name order.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Make translatable the name of the attachment in the e-commerce. This
   will mean to deal with the sorting of the translated terms.
