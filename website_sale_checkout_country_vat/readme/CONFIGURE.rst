The default country that will appear is the one of the current user, or the one
of the Public User assigned to the website, or the one of the company that owns
the website. Change it in the corresponding place to get a sane default.

If you want to have a sane default also in the country address, check the
`website_sale_default_country
<https://github.com/OCA/e-commerce/tree/10.0/website_sale_default_country>`_
module.
