Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/
e-commerce/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please check there if your issue has
already been reported. If you spotted it first, help us smashing it by
providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Shopping terms and conditions are accepted only on user registration or
  address edition. So if those terms change after the user signed up, a
  notification should be made. An implicit acceptance could be printed in the
  payment screen to solve this. Maybe that could be a work to develope in
  another module.
