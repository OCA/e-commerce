This module extends your e-commerce legal compliance options:

#. Require accepting legal terms before submitting a new address.
#. Log a note in the partner when such terms are accepted.
#. Log a note in the sale order when terms are accepted before payment
   (done for every online payment, it is an upstream feature).

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Install it.

#. Set up `your legal pages </legal>`__.

#. Go to your e-commerce and make a sample checkout.

#. Visit `/shop/address </shop/address>`__ and enable *Customize > Require
   Legal Terms Acceptance*.

   .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/e-commerce/15.0/website_sale_require_legal/static/description/address-enable.png

   This will require acceptance before recording a new address, and log visitor's
   acceptance.

#. Visit `/shop/payment </shop/payment>`__ and enable *Customize > Accept Terms
   & Conditions* (upstream Odoo feature).

   .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/e-commerce/15.0/website_sale_require_legal/static/description/payment-enable.png

   This will require acceptance before paying the sale order, and log visitor's
   acceptance.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Buy something from your website.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Shopping terms and conditions are accepted only on user registration or
  address edition. So if those terms change after the user signed up, a
  notification should be made. An implicit acceptance could be printed in the
  payment screen to solve this. Maybe that could be a work to develop in
  another module.
* If you enable both acceptance views as explained in the configuration section,
  first-time buyers will have to accept the legal terms between 2 and 3 times
  to buy.
