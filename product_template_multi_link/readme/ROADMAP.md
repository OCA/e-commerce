- This module links templates together. 'product_multi_link' links
  variants together. We could, in a next version of Odoo, include
  variants features in that module, and adding a new group in 'Manage
  Product Variant Links'.
- Develop another module product_template_multi_link_customer, that adds
  a new type of link named 'customer'. Those links could be generated
  automatically by scheduled cron task, analyzing sale.order.line. Odoo
  could create so, the 3 most products sold when a given product is
  sold.
