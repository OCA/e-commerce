This module extends the functionality of sale module to support links
between products templates.

This module adds two types of links :

- **Cross Selling** : suggest your customer to purchase an additional
  product
- **Up Selling** : suggest your customers to purchase a higher-end
  product, an upgrade, etc.

These types of links are common in e-commerce shops.

It can be used as a base to implement synchronizations with e-commerce.

## Important Note

This module is linking products together (product templates), not
product variants. For that purpose, you can use the module Product Multi
Link (Variants), in the same OCA / e-commerce repository.
