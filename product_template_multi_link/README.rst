This module extends the functionality of sale module to support links
between products templates.

This module adds two types of links :

-  **Cross Selling** : suggest your customer to purchase an additional
   product
-  **Up Selling** : suggest your customers to purchase a higher-end
   product, an upgrade, etc.

These types of links are common in e-commerce shops.

It can be used as a base to implement synchronizations with e-commerce.

Important Note
--------------

This module is linking products together (product templates), not
product variants. For that purpose, you can use the module Product Multi
Link (Variants), in the same OCA / e-commerce repository.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  This module links templates together. 'product_multi_link' links
   variants together. We could, in a next version of Odoo, include
   variants features in that module, and adding a new group in 'Manage
   Product Variant Links'.
-  Develop another module product_template_multi_link_customer, that
   adds a new type of link named 'customer'. Those links could be
   generated automatically by scheduled cron task, analyzing
   sale.order.line. Odoo could create so, the 3 most products sold when
   a given product is sold.
