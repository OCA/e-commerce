This module extends the functionality of sale module to support links between
products templates.

This module adds two types of links :

- **Cross Selling** : suggest your customer to purchase an additional product
- **Up Selling** : suggest your customers to purchase a higher-end product,
  an upgrade, etc.

These types of links are common in e-commerce shops.

It can be used as a base to implement synchronizations with e-commerce.

Important Note
--------------

This module is linking products together (product templates), not product
variants. For that purpose, you can use the module Product Multi Link
(Variants), in the same OCA / e-commerce repository.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module links templates together. 'product_multi_link' links variants
  together. We could, in a next version of Odoo, include variants features
  in that module, and adding a new group in 'Manage Product Variant Links'.

* Develop another module product_template_multi_link_customer, that adds
  a new type of link named 'customer'. Those links could be generated
  automatically by scheduled cron task, analyzing sale.order.line.
  Odoo could create so, the 3 most products sold when a given product is
  sold.
