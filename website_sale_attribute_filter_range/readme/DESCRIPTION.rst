This module adds a filter range in the website
Take the attribute values included between the selected range, and applies the filter.

In product detail page, attributes of type 'range' are shown the same as attributes of type 'select'.
I opted to copy the selects functionality in the product view to avoid problems if another module modifies the 't-if'.
