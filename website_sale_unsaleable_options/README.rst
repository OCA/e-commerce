e-commerce unsaleable options
=============================

This module prevents optional products to be sold singularly.
That is, they can only be sold if associated to their main product.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to Sale > Products
#. Choose a product e.g. iMac
#. Go to SALES tab
#. Click on Edit and add an optional product, e.g. Apple Wireless Keyboard
#. Now go to the shop frontend
#. Pick Apple Wireless Keyboard and click on Add to Cart
#. A warning will be displayed, notifying the user the item can't be added directly to the cart.
