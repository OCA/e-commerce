The eCommerce address presentation (in /shop/address) of vanilla Odoo does not cover
the format of some countries.

This module adds the capability to change the address field sequence in the eCommerce
address page.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

Go to Contacts > Configuration > Localization > Countries, and open the country for
which the address field sequence should be adjusted in the eCommerce address page.

Update 'Layout in eCommerce Address Forms' field with something like the below (an
example for Japan):

.. code-block::

  %(country_name)s
  %(zip)s
  %(state_code)s
  %(city)s
  %(street)s
  %(street2)s
