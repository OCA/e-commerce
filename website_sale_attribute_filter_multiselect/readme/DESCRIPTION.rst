This module extends the functionality of website sale module to allow to select multiple product attributes with checkboxes
In product detail page, attributes of type 'range' are shown the same as attributes of type 'select'.

I opted to copy the selects functionality in the product view to avoid problems if another module modifies the 't-if'.
