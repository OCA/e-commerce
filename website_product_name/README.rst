========================
Product Name for website
========================

Does your odoo instance have super long or complicated product names?
Do these names serve you well but are not very attractive on your website?
This module adds a field in product to show a different name for a product on the website.

Usage
=====
In the Product form, under the tab "sales" you will find a field named
"Product name on website", if filled, that will be the name of that
product on the website.


Known Issues / Roadmap
======================

* Will not allow to edit website name from website (no inverse for computed field)
