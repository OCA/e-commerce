==============================
Product Multi Links (Variants)
==============================

This module adds links between product variants:

- cross-selling
- up-selling
- related

These types of links are common in e-commerce shops.

It can be used as a base to implement synchronizations with
e-commerce (for instance, it is used in magentoerpconnect).

If you want to manage link between product templates (instead of product
variants), you can use the other OCA module product_template_multi_link.
(Same e-commerce repository)

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to Sale > Configuration > Products > Product Links
