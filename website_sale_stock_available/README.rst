This module extends the functionality of the *Product Availability* module
(technical name: ``website_sale_stock``) so that for the eCommerce the *Available*
quantity of a product is taken into account instead of the *free* quantity.

Note that in the past the eCommerce availability was based in *Forecasted quantity*. This
isn't true anymore from version 15.0.

If a product is configured to *prevent sales if not enough stock*
(see configuration section) and its page is accessed in the Website Shop,
the availability messages will be based on the *Available* quantity instead of
*Free* quantity. And also, the eCommerce won't allow you to buy more products than
*Available* quantity (not *Free* quantity isn't taken into account).

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Inventory > Master Data > Products* and edit a product that
   you only want to sell in the eCommerce if there is enough stock.
#. Navigate to *Out-of-stock (continue selling)* field in the *Sales* tab and unset it.
#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings*, navigate to *Stock available
   to promise* section and set the desired option (you might need extra modules). If you
   do not choose any, the value of *Available* quantity will be equal to *Forecasted*
   quantity.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to your eCommerce.
#. Select a product that you has been previously configured to *prevent sales
   if not enough stock* for the web product page.
#. Odoo doesn't allow you to add the product to the cart if *Available*
   quantity (not *Free to use* quantity) is equal or less than zero.
   Besides, availability messages will be based on the *Available*
   quantity instead of the *Free to use* quantity.
